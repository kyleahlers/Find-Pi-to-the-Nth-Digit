# Find-Pi-to-the-Nth-Digit
Project idea from Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp

Program that uses the Nilakantha infinate series in order to approximate the irrational number, Pi

The program has a built-in limit of 1 million iterations to conserve processing power, but can simply be edited in the main function

There are two .py files:
1. The primary file, "nilakantha.py" named after the Indian mathematician and astronomer
2. The supporting file with a few functions inside, "support_functions.py".
